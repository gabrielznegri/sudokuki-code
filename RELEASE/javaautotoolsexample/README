Java Autotools Example
======================

This package is a simple example of a Java package following
GNU packaging standards (or at least trying to follow them).

Feel free to use this package as a starting point if you want
to write a Java application that can be built with the classical
sequence:
  ./configure && make && sudo make install

This package is written in the hope it will be useful to Java
developers or maintainers who want to make their program easier
to build and install on a standard GNU/Linux distribution but
who are not familiar with the Autotools.

This package uses the following classical autotools configuration
files:
  configure.ac (Autoconf configuration file)
  Makefile.am, src/Makefile.am (Automake configuration files)

Features
========

- Can be installed using the standard ./configure && make && sudo make install
- Provides a basic Java / JNI application package upon which you can build your Java project if you like.
  This is Free Software ("Free" as in Freedom) - check the license terms (GPL v3+).
- Tested on GNU/Linux (gNewSense 2.3 deltah)
- Tested on MS-Windows with MinGW 1.0. N.B: use the "-Wl,--kill-at" for 'configure':
    ./configure LDFLAGS="-Wl,--kill-at"
  Starting on a fresh unpacked archive is strongly recommended.
