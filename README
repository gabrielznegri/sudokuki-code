Sudokuki is being completely rewritten at the moment.
It is no more based on Gtkmm for the GUI. The GUI is now
written in Java and based on Swing. The main reason to 
this is that the author is having fun rewriting the
program from C++ to Java and to learn more about Swing. 

The author is also hoping to make it easier for users
and contributors (developers, testers, translators) to
help with the project, because using Java, Sudokuki
is expected to be easier to install and run.
